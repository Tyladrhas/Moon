<p>Been developing some of the general assets for the world. Been working on some UV mapping mostly, trying to get really good textures onto low poly models to make them look amazing. Pretty happy with how it is coming along.</p>

<p>The texturing on that is from a photo of a real bridge, I wanted to really make it appear like an old overgrown bridge, while still maintaining the cute style for cohesion with the disproportionate game world.</p>

<p>Stylized cave for the troll. Worked with putting some vines and leave textures on it to make it look overgrown. I think it makes it a bit too flowery though, maybe replace everything with thorns?</p>
